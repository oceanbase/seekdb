  Tablet is created/deleted through MDS which has transactional meaning.
  Consider creating tablet as inserting a row to database, and deleting tablet as
  remove a row from database. So below ObMDSGetTabletMode can be understood as read
  isolation level in a database.

  READ_ALL_COMMITED:
    Read committed row after transaction committed, except empty shell.
    Return tablet which has finished at least one MDS transaction(not including tablet in NORMAL not committed, TRANSFER_IN not committed status).
    Not return CREATING and DELETING who was abandoned from 4.2.
    In addition, you should NOT pass read timeout under this mode.

  READ_WITHOUT_CHECK:
    Read uncommitted row. Return tablet whatever it is in a MDS transaction or not.

  READ_READABLE_COMMITED:
    Read committed row, not include deleted one. The most frequently used mode. Return
    tablet in NORMAL, TRANSFER_IN status. Not return one in unreadable status.
    If latest tablet status is TRANSFER_OUT, we should check transfer scn to decide
    whether it is legal to return the tablet.
    If read operation reaches read timeout, you'll get OB_ERR_SHARED_LOCK_CONFLICT error.
